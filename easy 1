Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

code:
def len_of_lastword(string):
  words = string.split()
  if not words:
     return 0
  return  len(words[-1])

if _name_ == "_main_':
  string = "Hello World"
  result = len_of_lastword(string)
  print(result)

Logic:
Trim any leading or trailing spaces from the input string to handle cases where there might be spaces at the beginning or end of the string.
Split the string into words using a space as a delimiter.
Check if there are any words in the resulting list.
If there are words, return the length of the last word. Otherwise, return 0

Algorithm:
1. Function length_of_last_word(s):
2.     Trim leading and trailing spaces from s.
3.     Split s into words using space as a delimiter.
4.     If the list of words is not empty:
5.         Return the length of the last word in the list.
6.     Else:
7.         Return 0.
