You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
  
  code:
  def shortest_palindrome(s):
    rev_s = s[::-1]
    for i in range(len(s) + 1):
        if s.startswith(rev_s[i:]):
            return rev_s[:i] + s

if _name_ == "_main_":
  s = "aacecaaa"
  result = shortest_palindrome(s)
  print(result)
