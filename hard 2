You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
  
  code:
  def shortest_palindrome(s):
    rev_s = s[::-1]
    for i in range(len(s) + 1):
        if s.startswith(rev_s[i:]):
            return rev_s[:i] + s

if _name_ == "_main_":
  s = "aacecaaa"
  result = shortest_palindrome(s)
  print(result)

Logic:
Find the longest palindrome that starts from the beginning of the string s.
Append the reversed substring (excluding the palindrome part) to the front of the string.

Algorithm:
1. Function shortest_palindrome(s):
2.     Find the longest palindrome starting from the beginning of s.
3.     Append the reversed substring (excluding the palindrome part) to the front of s.
4.     Return the resulting string.

1. Function find_longest_prefix_palindrome(s):
2.     Initialize a variable max_len to 0.
3.     Iterate i from 0 to the length of s - 1:
4.         If s[0:i+1] is a palindrome:
5.             Update max_len to i + 1.
6.     Return the longest palindrome substring s[0:max_len].

1. Function is_palindrome(substring):
2.     Initialize pointers i and j to the start and end of the substring.
3.     While i < j:
4.         If substring[i] is not equal to substring[j], return False.
5.         Increment i and decrement j.
6.     Return True.
